# Pull Request Notifier for Stash Changelog

Changelog of Pull Request Notifier for Stash.

## 1.18
* Avoiding endless loop if user not 'System Admin' when editing configuration
* Triggers can be named. To make it easier to keep track of them in large installations.
* Trigger Notification Buttons on Pull Request View
 * And ${BUTTON_TRIGGER_TITLE} variable resolving to title of pressed button
* Building against latest Stash version (3.11.1) using latest Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite version (6.0.3)
* Adding PULL_REQUEST_URL variable. Points to the pull request view in Stash.

## 1.17
* Ignoring events if pull request is closed

## 1.16
* Triggering also on comment replies if COMMENTED event is checked.

## 1.15
* Removing RESCOPED event, its confusing when to use it together with _FROM and _TO. RESCOPED was triggered when both _FROM and _TO changed at the exact same time. Now, just check _FROM if you only want to trigger when source branch changes, _TO if only target and both if you want to trigger for both.
* Adding logging to make it easier to debug what events are triggered.

## 1.14
* New variables with information about the user who issued the event
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_USER_DISPLAY_NAME} Example: Some User
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS} Example: some.user@stash.domain
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_USER_ID} Example: 1
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_USER_NAME} Example: user.name
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_USER_SLUG} Example: user.name

## 1.13
* Bugfix
 * Letting PULL_REQUEST_FROM_BRANCH, and PULL_REQUEST_TO_BRANCH, evaluate to branch display name. A branch with slashes in name, like "feature/branchmodmerge", will no longer be evaluated to "branchmodmerge" but keep the name "feature/branchmodmerge".

## 1.12
* Adding clone URL variables
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_FROM_HTTP_CLONE_URL} Example: http://admin@localhost:7990/stash/scm/project_1/rep_1.git
 * ${PULL_REQUEST_FROM_SSH_CLONE_URL} Example: ssh://git@localhost:7999/project_1/rep_1

## 1.11
* Custom HTTP headers
* Proxy support
* Stash Data Center compatibility
* Adding PULL_REQUEST_COMMENT_TEXT and PULL_REQUEST_VERSION variables

## 1.10

## 1.9
* Adding support for PUT and DELETE

## 1.8
* Support for HTTP POST requests, with content that is rendered with variables
* Letting variable ${PULL_REQUEST_ACTION} return RESCOPED_FROM or RESCOPED_TO instead of just RESCOPED

## 1.7
* Not sending authentication headers when user and/or password is not set
* Adding RESCOPED_FROM and RESCOPED_TO event types

 * ${PULL_REQUEST_AUTHOR_SLUG} Example: admin

## 1.4
* Bugfix: Avoiding multiple notifications being sent from same event.

## 1.3
Same as version 1.2 but with different version number. When version 1.2 was initially rejected I fixed the issue and created a new 1.2. But a new version number was needed for a resubmission to Atlassian Marketplace.

## 1.2
* Compatible with Java 7, was compatible with Java 8 since java.util.Base64 was accidently used

## 1.1
* Adding support for filters
* Adding support for PULL_REQUEST_TO_HASH and PULL_REQUEST_FROM_HASH variables
* Fixing authentication bug
* Making it compatible with Stash 2.12.0

## 1.0
Initial Release
